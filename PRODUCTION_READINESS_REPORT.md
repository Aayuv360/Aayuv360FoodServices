- **Environment Security**: Cleaned duplicate secrets and standardized configuration
- **Health Endpoints**: Added proper health monitoring at `/api/health` and `/api/database-health`
- **Rate Limiting Fix**: Fixed express-rate-limit trust proxy configuration for Replit/Render environments

### 🏗️ System Architecture
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas connection stable and healthy
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
- **Cache**: Redis fallback to in-memory storage for Replit environment
- **Payment Gateway**: Razorpay integration functional with test credentials

### 📊 API Functionality

✅ POST /api/auth/register - User registration working
✅ POST /api/auth/login - Authentication successful
✅ GET /api/meals - 38 meals loading correctly
✅ GET /api/subscription-plans - 3 plans available
```

### Performance Metrics
```
Response Times:
- Health check: ~3ms
- Database health: ~231ms
- User registration: ~1327ms (includes bcrypt hashing)
- Login: ~585ms
- Meals API: ~691ms (38 items from MongoDB)

Memory Usage:
- Heap Used: 261 MB
- Heap Total: 295 MB
- Status: Healthy
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
